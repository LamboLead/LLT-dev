> Visual elements

  > Create a new section 'Visual elements' to show information in a certain way (cards (horizontal, vertical), boxes, top-to-bottom text, etc). Take into account animations on mount/unmount

> Form

  > Set up different types of fields
  > Set up datasource for certain fields
  # dataSource: ['Value 1', 'Value 2', ...]
  # dataSource: () => {
  #  Fetch.post('http://localhost:3007/careers', ...)
  # }
  # import someJson from '/src/someJSON.json';
  # dataSource: someJson.careers
  > Improve styles for SelectWithSearch element
  > Think about the code to show different sections with different fields.
    Example:
    'MainSection' has the introduction to the form
    'PersonalData' has fields regarding the personal data of the person
      If the person checks the 'Do you study?' field as 'YES', the section 'Career' appears in the form
      # linksTo: 'Career'
      # on: 'Checked'
    'Career' has fields regarding the career of the person
      # name: 'Career'
      # appearAs: 'Inline'

* Events

> Set up views and information

* Data

- Write a better code (organize, normalize functions) to organize the information fetched from the database.

* Interactivity

> Figure out a better way to implement click outside events

* Administration

> Set up log in (add a password for each member)
> Start with the admin views to manage all the information of the page
